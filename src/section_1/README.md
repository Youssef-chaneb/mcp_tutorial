# MCP Tutorial - Section 1: Introduction

This section provides an introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), explaining its purpose, architecture, and how it enables AI models to interact with external tools and resources.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what MCP is and why it's important for AI tool integration
- Learn about the MCP architecture and its implementation in AI applications
- Get familiar with the key components of the MCP ecosystem
- Prepare your environment for the tutorial (Python 3.10+ required)

## Files in this Section

- `introduction.md`: Comprehensive overview of MCP and its significance
- `architecture.md`: Detailed explanation of MCP architecture and components
- `setup.py`: Script to verify your environment is properly configured
- `hello_mcp.py`: A simple "Hello World" example demonstrating basic MCP concepts

## Getting Started

1. Read through the introduction and architecture documents to understand the MCP ecosystem
2. Run the setup script to ensure your environment is correctly configured:

```bash
python src/section_1/setup.py
```

3. Try the "Hello World" example to get hands-on experience with MCP:

```bash
python src/section_1/hello_mcp.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A framework for standardized communication between AI models and external tools
- **Tools**: Functions that models can call to perform actions or retrieve information
- **Resources**: External data or services that tools can utilize
- **Server**: Component that registers and exposes tools for models to use
- **Client**: Component that connects to the server and enables models to call tools

## Next Steps

After completing this section, you'll be ready to explore client-server fundamentals in Section 2, where you'll set up both a server and client to establish your first working MCP system.
